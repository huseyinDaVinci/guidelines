PRESENTATION LAYER    (MVP)   

-------interactors--------

DOMAIN LAYER  ( Regular java objects (business logic here.) )

-------boundaries--------
DATA LAYER    ( Repository Pattern here. )



						   
(Subscribers<T>)             (Observables<T>)               (Observables<T>)
Views (UI)  | Presenter |  Domain Use Cases | Repository | -> Cloud or Disk





							RULES OF MINE          
- Views (UI) will be dumb as much as possible.
- Seperation of layers. (decoupling) 
- Seperations of Tests

  PRESENTATION LAYER  (Espresso Tests (only for Android specific ui tests))
  DOMAIN LAYER   	  (Unit Tests + Functional Tests -Pure java class)
  DATA LAYER          (Reggression Tests)
  
  
- Be Solid during the project life cycle.
